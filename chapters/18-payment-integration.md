# Chapter 18: Payment Integration with Stripe

Payment integration is a crucial aspect of modern applications, enabling businesses to handle transactions securely and efficiently. This chapter introduces billing platforms like Stripe, their benefits, common pitfalls such as Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, and a step-by-step guide to integrating Stripe into your application.

## Introduction to Billing Integrations

Billing integrations allow applications to process payments, subscriptions, and refunds. Platforms like Stripe provide APIs and tools to simplify these operations while ensuring compliance with payment industry standards.

### Why Use Stripe?
1. **Ease of Integration**: Intuitive APIs and developer tools.
2. **Global Reach**: Supports multiple currencies and payment methods.
3. **Security**: PCI compliance and fraud prevention tools.
4. **Customizability**: Tailor payment flows to your application’s needs.

### Common Use Cases
1. **One-Time Payments**: Process single transactions for products or services.
2. **Recurring Subscriptions**: Handle recurring billing for SaaS or memberships.
3. **Marketplaces**: Split payments between vendors and administrators.

## Understanding Know Your Customer (KYC) Requirements

KYC is a regulatory standard to verify the identities of customers and businesses to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illegal activities.

### Stripe and KYC
1. **Account Verification**: Stripe requires documentation for businesses, such as tax IDs and bank account details.
2. **Compliance**: Ensure your platform complies with local regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
3. **Impact**: Delayed or incomplete KYC can prevent payouts.

### Avoiding Pitfalls
1. Collect accurate user details during onboarding.
2. Automate reminders for incomplete KYC submissions.
3. Regularly review local compliance updates.

## Integrating Stripe into Your Application

### Step 1: Set Up a Stripe Account
1. Sign up for a Stripe account at [Stripe’s website](https://stripe.com/).
2. Complete the onboarding process, including KYC verification.

### Step 2: Install the Stripe SDK
Install the Stripe SDK in your application:
```bash
npm install stripe
```

### Step 3: Create Payment Intents
1. Import and configure the Stripe SDK:
   ```javascript
   const Stripe = require('stripe');
   const stripe = Stripe('your-secret-key');
   ```
2. Create a payment intent:
   ```javascript
   app.post('/create-payment-intent', async (req, res) => {
       const { amount, currency } = req.body;

       try {
           const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
               amount: amount,
               currency: currency,
           });
           res.json({ clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret });
       } catch (error) {
           res.status(500).send(error.message);
       }
   });
   ```

### Step 4: Implement the Frontend
1. Use Stripe.js to collect payment details:
   ```html
   <script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
   ```
2. Integrate the payment form:
   ```javascript
   const stripe = Stripe('your-public-key');

   const handlePayment = async () => {
       const response = await fetch('/create-payment-intent', {
           method: 'POST',
           headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
           body: JSON.stringify({ amount: 1000, currency: 'usd' })
       });

       const { clientSecret } = await response.json();
       const result = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(clientSecret, {
           payment_method: {
               card: elements.getElement(CardElement),
           },
       });

       if (result.error) {
           console.error('Payment failed:', result.error);
       } else {
           console.log('Payment successful:', result.paymentIntent);
       }
   };
   ```

### Step 5: Set Up Subscriptions
Stripe provides APIs to manage recurring subscriptions efficiently.

1. **Create a Product**:
   - Log in to the Stripe Dashboard.
   - Navigate to the Products section and create a new product with a recurring price.

2. **Implement Subscription Logic**:
   ```javascript
   app.post('/create-subscription', async (req, res) => {
       const { customerId, priceId } = req.body;

       try {
           const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.create({
               customer: customerId,
               items: [{ price: priceId }],
           });
           res.json(subscription);
       } catch (error) {
           res.status(500).send(error.message);
       }
   });
   ```

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Collect customer details and call the `/create-subscription` endpoint.
   - Display subscription status and handle errors gracefully.

4. **Manage Subscription Lifecycle**:
   - Handle webhook events for subscription updates (e.g., renewals, cancellations).

### Step 6: Test and Deploy
1. Use Stripe’s test environment to simulate subscription scenarios.
2. Verify webhook configurations and event handling.
3. Switch to live mode and enable subscriptions for production.

## Best Practices for Payment Integration
1. **Secure API Keys**: Store API keys in environment variables.
2. **Handle Webhooks Securely**: Verify webhook signatures to prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Monitor Transactions**: Use Stripe’s dashboard for real-time analytics.
4. **Error Handling**: Provide clear feedback for failed payments.
