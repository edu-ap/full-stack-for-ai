# Chapter 14: Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting

Ensuring application reliability and performance requires robust systems for logging, monitoring, and alerting. These processes help developers and operators detect, debug, and resolve issues efficiently. This chapter introduces the fundamentals of these practices, common tools, and practical examples.

## Logging

Logging is the process of recording events, errors, and other information generated by an application. Logs are crucial for debugging, performance analysis, and maintaining audit trails.

### Types of Logs
1. **Application Logs**: Capture events, errors, and operational details from application code.
2. **System Logs**: Provide information about the operating system and server environment.
3. **Access Logs**: Record HTTP requests, user activity, and API usage.

### Best Practices for Logging
1. **Log Levels**:
   - **DEBUG**: Detailed diagnostic information.
   - **INFO**: General operational information.
   - **WARNING**: Indications of potential issues.
   - **ERROR**: Events that disrupt application functionality.
   - **CRITICAL**: Severe issues requiring immediate attention.
2. **Structured Logs**: Use JSON or similar formats for machine-readable logs.
3. **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs from multiple services using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd.

### Example: Logging with Node.js
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`${new Date().toISOString()} - ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

## Monitoring

Monitoring involves tracking application and system performance metrics to ensure smooth operations. It provides insights into resource usage, response times, and potential bottlenecks.

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **CPU and Memory Usage**
2. **Disk I/O and Network Traffic**
3. **Application Latency and Throughput**
4. **Error Rates**

### Tools for Monitoring
1. **Prometheus**: Open-source system for collecting and querying metrics.
2. **Grafana**: Visualization tool for creating real-time dashboards.
3. **Datadog**: Comprehensive monitoring platform for cloud-scale applications.

### Example: Setting Up Prometheus and Grafana
1. Install Prometheus and Grafana on your server.
2. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your application:
   ```yaml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'node_app'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['localhost:3000']
   ```
3. Visualize metrics in Grafana by connecting it to Prometheus as a data source.

## Alerting

Alerting notifies operators about critical issues or anomalies in real time. Effective alerting minimizes downtime and helps maintain user satisfaction.

### Components of an Alerting System
1. **Thresholds**: Define conditions that trigger alerts (e.g., CPU usage > 80%).
2. **Notification Channels**: Deliver alerts via email, SMS, or integrations like Slack or PagerDuty.
3. **Incident Management**: Document and respond to alerts systematically.

### Tools for Alerting
1. **Alertmanager**: Integrated with Prometheus for alert handling.
2. **Opsgenie**: Incident management and alerting tool.
3. **Slack**: Integrate with monitoring tools for real-time notifications.

### Example: Creating Alerts in Prometheus
1. Define alerting rules in the Prometheus configuration:
   ```yaml
   alerting:
     alertmanagers:
       - static_configs:
           - targets: ['localhost:9093']
   
   rules:
     - alert: HighCPUUsage
       expr: process_cpu_seconds_total > 80
       for: 1m
       labels:
         severity: critical
       annotations:
         summary: "High CPU usage detected"
   ```
2. Configure Alertmanager to send notifications via Slack or email.

## Summary

In this chapter, you learned:
- The importance of logging, monitoring, and alerting for maintaining reliable applications.
- Best practices for logging and monitoring key metrics.
- Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager for effective monitoring and alerting.
- Practical examples of implementing these systems in Node.js applications.

By integrating logging, monitoring, and alerting, you can proactively identify and resolve issues, ensuring robust and user-friendly applications. In the next chapter, weâ€™ll explore database setup and management to store and retrieve application data effectively.
